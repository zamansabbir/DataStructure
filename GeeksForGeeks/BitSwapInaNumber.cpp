/**
 * Given a number x and two positions (from the right side) in the binary representation 
 * of x, write a function that swaps n bits at given two positions and returns the result.
 * It is also given that the two sets of bits do not overlap.

 *  Let p1 and p2 be the two given positions.
 * 
 * Input:
x = 47 (00101111)
p1 = 1 (Start from the second bit from the right side)
p2 = 5 (Start from the 6th bit from the right side)
n = 3 (No of bits to be swapped)
Output:
227 (11100011)
The 3 bits starting from the second bit (from the right side) are 
swapped with 3 bits starting from 6th position (from the right side)
